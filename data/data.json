    "title": "The Howling of Hellingly Asylum",
    "country": "England",
    "timeStamp": "October 31, 1845 00:00",
    "story": "The fog, thick as grave dust, clung to the walls of Hellingly Asylum on that Halloween night. Inside, the air tasted of mildew and madness. Dr. Armitage, the asylum's head physician, found himself inexplicably drawn to the abandoned West Wing, a place even the orderlies avoided after sunset. They whispered of patients driven insane, not by their minds, but by something dwelling within those crumbling walls. \n\nHe carried a single lantern, its weak beam barely piercing the gloom. The floorboards groaned under his weight, each creak echoing through the desolate corridors like a mournful sigh. He passed empty cells, their iron bars rusting, each a cage for forgotten horrors. The temperature plummeted, and a spectral chill crawled down his spine. \n\nSuddenly, a bloodcurdling howl ripped through the silence, originating from the deepest recesses of the West Wing. It was not the howl of an animal, nor of a human, but something inhuman, something that resonated with a primal fear he never knew he possessed. His heart hammered against his ribs. \n\nHe pressed on, driven by a morbid curiosity he couldn't suppress. The howl grew louder, closer. He reached the central chamber, a vast, circular room where patients had once been subjected to experimental treatments. In the center, a dark figure writhed. It was skeletal, its skin stretched taut over bone, and its eyes glowed with malevolent green light. It wasn't human. It was the embodiment of the asylum's collective suffering. \n\nAs the creature turned towards him, emitting a guttural shriek, Dr. Armitage saw his own face reflected in its eyes – twisted, broken, and consumed by the same madness that permeated the asylum. He felt a chilling premonition: he was not observing madness, he was becoming it. The creature lunged, and the lantern fell, plunging the chamber into darkness, save for the creature’s ghastly green eyes. The last thing Dr. Armitage heard was the creature's unholy laughter, echoing through the halls of Hellingly, forever claiming him as its own."

    "title": "The Shadow of Brașov: A Halloween Dirge",
    "country": "Romania",
    "timeStamp": "October 31, 1845 00:00",
    "story": "The biting wind howled through the Transylvanian Alps, rattling the shutters of my humble cottage in Brașov. It was Halloween, 1845, and the veil between worlds felt thinner than ever. A perpetual twilight clung to the village, deepened by the swirling fog that crept from the Borgo Pass. Old woman Elara had warned me: 'Tonight, the strigoi walk, and the forest whispers secrets best left unheard.'\n\nI ignored her, dismissing it as folklore. But as the clock tower tolled midnight, a guttural growl echoed from the forest. My blood ran cold. The oil lamp flickered violently, casting grotesque shadows that danced on the walls like macabre puppets. A scratching sound, like nails dragging across stone, emanated from the cellar. \n\nArmed with a crucifix and a flickering candle, I descended the rickety stairs. The air grew thick, heavy with the stench of damp earth and something else… something indescribably foul. At the bottom, a dark figure crouched, its back to me. It was impossibly tall, its limbs elongated and spindly. A low moan escaped its throat, a sound that seemed to claw at my sanity.\n\nSlowly, it turned. Its face was a grotesque parody of humanity – skin stretched taut over bone, eyes burning with malevolent red fire, fangs bared in a silent snarl. It reeked of grave dirt and decay. The candle flame guttered, threatening to plunge me into darkness. I raised the crucifix, but the creature only laughed, a dry, rasping sound that resonated deep within my bones. It lunged. I screamed, a sound swallowed by the howling wind and the encroaching darkness. The last thing I saw was its crimson eyes, burning with an insatiable hunger, before the blackness consumed me entirely, another soul lost to the shadow of Brașov on this cursed Halloween night. The scratching continues, even now…"

    "title": "The Whispering Gallows of Mont-Saint-Michel",
    "country": "France",
    "timeStamp": "October 31, 1845 00:00",
    "story": "The biting wind whipped around Mont-Saint-Michel, carrying with it the mournful cries of the gulls – and something else, something…less natural. It was October 31st, 1845, and I, Jean-Luc, was the sole watchman for the night, a duty I’d begun to dread. The abbey, normally a place of spiritual solace, felt utterly corrupted, its ancient stones whispering secrets I dared not understand.\n\nThe whispers had started weeks ago, faint murmurs on the wind, growing steadily louder, more insistent. Now, they seemed to claw at my sanity. They spoke of sacrifice, of ancient rites performed in the catacombs beneath the abbey, of souls trapped between worlds. Tonight, on All Hallows' Eve, they were a cacophony, a chorus of damned souls shrieking for release.\n\nAround 10 PM, a fog rolled in, thick and unnatural, clinging to the causeway and obscuring the mainland. Visibility dropped to near zero. The flickering lantern I carried offered little comfort, casting grotesque shadows that danced on the damp stone walls. Then, I saw it. Or rather, felt it. A cold spot, so intense it made my teeth chatter, formed in the air before me. The whispers intensified, coalescing into a single, guttural voice that rasped, \"Libérez-nous… release us…\"\n\nI spun around, my heart hammering against my ribs. Nothing. But the cold intensified, the lantern flame guttered, threatening to extinguish. I stumbled backward, towards the abbey gates, my mind racing. The whispers spoke of the old gallows, erected centuries ago on the highest point of the island. They said the souls of those hanged there remained, tethered to the land, forever seeking vengeance.\n\nDriven by a primal fear, I peered into the fog-shrouded courtyard. And there it was. The gallows. Except…it was different. Blacker, taller, somehow…wrong. Three figures hung from its beam, their bodies swaying gently in the wind, their faces hidden by long, matted hair. But as I stared, paralyzed with terror, one of the figures slowly lifted its head. Its eyes, empty sockets burning with an unholy light, fixed on me.\n\nA silent scream ripped through the air. The figure’s mouth opened, wider than humanly possible, revealing rows upon rows of needle-sharp teeth. It emitted a sound, not a scream, but a chilling, soul-rending wail that echoed through the fog-bound island. The other two figures followed suit, their decaying bodies twisting and contorting in unnatural ways.\n\nI knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, that they were coming for me. The fog seemed to constrict, closing in, pressing against me like a suffocating shroud. I turned and fled, not towards the abbey, but away, towards the ramparts, hoping, praying for a miracle. But as I ran, I heard the sickening scrape of bone against wood, the rhythmic thud of rotting feet on stone, growing closer with each panicked breath. The whispering gallows had claimed another soul for Mont-Saint-Michel."
